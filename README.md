# ANR template

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This repository store an unofficial template for the ANR.

I am not against the official ANR word template but I see several limitations in it:
* You need word (proprietary and expensive).
* Strongly limited bibliography engine (usually Mendely so same as above x2).
*

## Example

## Previous version

This template is heavily based on the work initiated by Vincent labatut vincent.labatut@univ-avignon.fr.
His template is still maintained and may be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/unofficial-template-for-anr-proposals/yqgzsxkzrqkw).
Do not hesitate to have a look on his work!

This fork mainly adapted the previous template, made for PDFLaTeX, to the XeTeX engine.
It allows for the use of modern font, here [calibri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibri) and direct utf-8.
